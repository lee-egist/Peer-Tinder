DBC pairing app

###brainstormed so far###
* Rating system 
* Preferences for pairing
* Loop around to different people like pager/uber
* Automated pairing email conformation
* Preferences for new pairs & preferences for previos pairs
* avaliability selector
* ready for task indicator
* People get a pinged win there are new avaliablities for a task they are ready for.
* swipe right to pair 
* swipe left to skip - including promote for no more notifications
* after swiping through all possible pairs ask if they want to continue recieveing pair notifications from (this could get annoying though)


### Use case scenerios ###



##Questions##
* What if you set your avail? Send a request to pair and it returns a list of avail peeps
* the person who requested can't tell who swiped left for their invite. (or maybe we don't care) 

### What "messages" would the application send? ###
* "Waiting for suitable pair..."
* "Searching for available pairs..."
* "No one avaliable to pair yet..."


##Next Steps##

how to identify the class for our app
####what class do we need and what do these classes do?####
1. Gather application requirements - 
  * what does the app "need" to do what problem are we trying to solve?

resource - defining requirements - video
2. describe application - build a narrative in plan language to describe how the app works
  * use case  
  * user stories

3. identify most import objects
  * use the stories/use cases to pick out the most import 'things' in the app and discard everything else
  * Minimum Value Product

4. describe interaction of these objects
  * formally describe the interactions of those objects

5. create class diagram
  * visual representation of the class we need.
