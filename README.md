* swipe right to pair 
* swipe left to skip - including promote for no more notifications
* after swiping through all possible pairs ask if they want to continue recieveing pair notifications from (this could get annoying though)


### Use case scenerios ###



##Questions##
* What if you set your avail? Send a request to pair and it returns a list of avail peeps
* the person who requested can't tell who swiped left for their invite. (or maybe we don't care) 

### What "messages" would the application send? ###
* "Waiting for suitable pair..."
* "Searching for available pairs..."
* "No one avaliable to pair yet..."
